This is an amazing conglomeration of code developed piecemeal, which
I've roughly fit together.

The main pieces:

ngram.c - main, argument processing
range.c - used in argument processing

readapplication.c - the protocol readers/filters
readtransport.c
readinternet.c
readlink.c

entropy.c - byte-wise statistical entropy calculator/filter

snortcheck.c - check whether this packet has been tagged by snort
snorthostcheck.c - check whether this host has been tagged by snort
ymd.c - miscellaneous date routines, used by the above
readtree.c - miscellaneous file/directory routines, used by the above

arrayngram.c - ngram counters
bloom.c

In putting these things together, I've tried to regularize the
interfaces a bit, and make things configurable through command-line
arguments. The arguments are:

-I yes/no	- select/deselect based on protocol
-P protocol	- select/deselect only this protocol/set of protocols
-i yes/no	- select/deselect based on port
-p port		- select/deselect only this port/set of ports
		- both of the above can be comma-separated sets of ranges,
		  e.g., 2-6,34-90

-E yes/no	- select/deselect based on entropy
-e entropy	- range of entropy to select/deselect

-S yes/no	- select packets tagged/not tagged by snort
-s d1,d2,...	- directories and/or files of snort alerts to use
-t begin-end	- time range of snort alerts in yyyymmdd format

-H yes/no	- select hosts tagged/not tagged by snort
-h h1,h2,...	- hosts and/or subnets exempt from tagging

-L yes/no	- select/deselect listed hosts
-l h1,h2,...	- listed hosts

	lists may also be given as file=<file with list info>

-N filter	- which ngram filter to use (bloom, array ...)
-n low-high	- range of length of ngrams

-D dumpfile	- dump filter contents to this file
-d dumplevel	- debug level

-A shmfile	- allocate filters in this (permanent) shared memory region

-T start,end	- start and end time of packets to select

Typical usage:

ngram -P tcp -p 80 -E yes -e 0-7 -S no -s snortdir1,snortdir2 -N bloom -n 5-9 pcap1 pcap2 pcap3 ...

This collects ngrams only from low-entropy http packets not tagged by snort.
